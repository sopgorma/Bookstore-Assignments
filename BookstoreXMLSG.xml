		<description>As the sun sets in the west views of the Yellowstone National Forest, Oliver begins to hear the eerie noises of unknown wildlife. Startled, he turns back and quickens his pace, hoping to get back to his cabin before the sun is no longer his guide. However, after turning back, he takes a few strides and begins to notice that the once familiar terrain is quite different somehow. After attempting to retrace his steps for what seemed like hours, the moon becomes his only source of light. He is lost in the vastness of the lodgepole pines and cottonwood trees. He attempts to view his compass, hoping for a sense of direction back to his cabin, but as he searches for it through his backpack, he realizes that all of his gear has been rifled through and most of his belongings are gone. Just as he begins to fear the worst, a shotgun blast can be heard in the distance. Was it just a hunter, or something more sinister?</description>
